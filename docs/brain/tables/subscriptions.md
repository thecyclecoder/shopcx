# subscriptions

Synced from Appstle. items JSONB, billing interval, next billing date. Will become source of truth post-Appstle.

**Primary key:** `id`

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | — | PK · default: `gen_random_uuid()` |
| `workspace_id` | `uuid` | — | → [[workspaces]].id |
| `customer_id` | `uuid` | ✓ | → [[customers]].id |
| `shopify_contract_id` | `text` | — |  |
| `status` | `text` | — | default: `'active'` |
| `billing_interval` | `text` | ✓ |  |
| `billing_interval_count` | `int4` | ✓ |  |
| `next_billing_date` | `timestamptz` | ✓ |  |
| `last_payment_status` | `text` | ✓ |  |
| `items` | `jsonb` | ✓ | default: `'[]'` |
| `delivery_price_cents` | `int8` | ✓ | default: `0` |
| `shopify_customer_id` | `text` | ✓ |  |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | — | default: `now()` |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | — | default: `now()` |
| `consecutive_skips` | `int4` | ✓ | default: `0` |
| `pause_resume_at` | `timestamptz` | ✓ |  |
| `shipping_address` | `jsonb` | ✓ | Subscription-specific shipping address (fallback for customers who have a sub but never updated their account default_address). Order-creating actions resolve via [[../libraries/customer-shipping-address]], preferring `customers.default_address` first. |
| `subscription_created_at` | `timestamptz` | ✓ |  |
| `applied_discounts` | `jsonb` | — | default: `'[]'` |
| `is_internal` | `bool` | — | default: `false` |
| `shipping_protection_added` | `bool` | — | default: `false` |
| `shipping_protection_amount_cents` | `int4` | ✓ |  |
| `shipping_method_code` | `text` | ✓ | default: `'economy'` |
| `shipping_rate_id` | `uuid` | ✓ | → [[shipping_rates]].id |
| `avalara_quote_tax_cents` | `int4` | ✓ |  |
| `avalara_quote_total_cents` | `int4` | ✓ |  |
| `avalara_quote_at` | `timestamptz` | ✓ |  |
| `avalara_quote_address` | `jsonb` | ✓ |  |
| `comp` | `bool` | — | default: `false`. **Comp sub** — ships free on schedule (base $0, no PM, no charge). Pairs with item `price_override_cents=0` + `is_internal=true`. Renewal ships free only when the customer is comp-allowlisted ([[customers]].`comp_role`); else fails closed. |
| `comp_note` | `text` | ✓ | Free-text reason on the comp sub ("employee"). |
| `pricing_offer_id` | `uuid` | ✓ | → [[pricing_rule_offers]].id, `ON DELETE SET NULL`. The **persist-to-renewal offer** this sub was acquired under — a *reference, not a baked price*. The renewal engine ([[../libraries/pricing]]) applies the offer's delta while it is `active` + in-window; expiring/removing the offer reverts to base pricing automatically. Set by the deferred activation lever (owner-approval-gated). |

## RPC aggregations

Server-side RPCs for list queries + crisis/growth egress:
- [[../libraries/list-subscriptions-rpc]] — paginated filtered list with recovery status derivation (replaces the `?products=` / `?recovery=` truncation bugs; Phase 2 of [[../libraries/crisis-growth-rpcs]] sibling)
- [[../libraries/crisis-growth-rpcs]] — `crisis_affected_subs` aggregates active/paused subs by variant/SKU + MRR; `onsite_nonrenewal_revenue` bucketing for growth

## Common queries

### Customer's truly-active subscriptions
```ts
const ids = await linkedIds(admin, customerId);
const { data: subs } = await admin.from("subscriptions")
  .select("id, shopify_contract_id, status, items, billing_interval, next_billing_date, delivery_price_cents")
  .in("customer_id", ids)
  .eq("status", "active");   // lowercase
```

### Lookup by internal sub UUID (preferred for internal joins)
```ts
const { data } = await admin.from("subscriptions")
  .select("*").eq("id", subscriptionId).maybeSingle();
```

### All paused subscriptions in a workspace
```ts
const { data } = await admin.from("subscriptions")
  .select("id, customer_id, pause_resume_at")
  .eq("workspace_id", workspaceId)
  .eq("status", "paused");
```

### Subs auto-billing in the next 7 days
```ts
const soon = new Date(Date.now() + 7*86400e3).toISOString();
const { data } = await admin.from("subscriptions")
  .select("id, customer_id, next_billing_date, delivery_price_cents, items")
  .eq("workspace_id", workspaceId)
  .eq("status", "active")
  .lte("next_billing_date", soon);
```

### When was this sub cancelled? (event log, NOT a column)
```ts
const { data } = await admin.from("customer_events")
  .select("created_at, properties")
  .eq("event_type", "subscription.cancelled")
  .contains("properties", { subscription_id: subId })
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false }).limit(1).maybeSingle();
```

## Gotchas

- `status` is **lowercase**: `"active"`, `"paused"`, `"cancelled"`. `.eq("status", "ACTIVE")` returns zero rows.
- **`shipping_address` is a fallback, not authoritative.** Order-creating actions must NOT read it directly to resolve a shipment destination — they must use [[../libraries/customer-shipping-address]] `resolveCustomerShippingAddress()`, which prefers `customers.default_address` (the canonical current address) and uses the subscription address only when the customer's default and all cited orders are empty. Same priority applies to orders — a cited order's snapshot is the last resort, not the default.
- No `cancelled_at` / `paused_at` columns — the timestamp lives in `customer_events`. To know *when* a sub was cancelled, query the event log.
- **Internal joins ALWAYS use the UUID.** `id` (UUID) joins to `dunning_cycles.subscription_id`, `payment_failures.subscription_id`, `orders.subscription_id`, etc. `shopify_contract_id` + `shopify_customer_id` are Shopify-boundary fields ONLY — webhook ingest, Shopify API calls. Never use them as join keys between internal tables. They'll be deprecated once we sunset Shopify.
- Always include linked customers — use `linkedIds(customerId)` helper, then `.in("customer_id", ids)`.
- `items` is JSONB — variant ids live inside, not on a join table. Use `items->0->>'variantId'`. A **GIN index `idx_subscriptions_items_gin (items jsonb_path_ops)`** (migration `20260708120000`) backs `@>` containment on `items` — e.g. "subs carrying product X" via `items @> '[{"product_id":"…"}]'`. All rows store `items` as an array whose elements carry `product_id` (verified 2026-07-08), so containment is exact + complete.
- **`estimate_sub_ltv(p_workspace_id, p_product_id)` RPC** (migration `20260708120000`) — the aggregate behind [[../libraries/storefront-ltv-proxy]] `estimateSubLTV`. Does the `subscriptions ⋈ orders` renewal/revenue rollup + a customer-links-aware LTV cross-check server-side, returning one row of scalars. Replaced a per-product full-scan (unindexed `created_at` sort → 314 GB temp-spill, the offender Devi/[[../libraries/db-health]] now attributes) + two order-row-shipping `.in()` loops that silently hit Supabase's 1000-row cap and undercounted. 29–65× faster AND correct.
- **`payment_method_id`** (uuid → [[customer_payment_methods]].id, nullable, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) — the **pinned** vaulted Braintree card the renewal charges for *this* sub. NULL = the customer's default. Internal subs only; set via the portal's per-sub card picker (`setSubscriptionPaymentMethod`). The renewal prefers it, falling back to the default if absent/removed.
- **`comp=true` = ships free.** A comp sub is `is_internal=true` with every item `price_override_cents=0` (base $0). The renewal ([[../inngest/internal-subscription-renewals]]) takes a dedicated branch: **gate first** — if the customer's [[customers]].`comp_role` is null/invalid → FAIL CLOSED (failed `type='comp'` transaction + `subscription.comp_renewal_failed` event, no shipment, no advance); else skip PM/Braintree/Avalara/shipping, create a $0 `paid` order (does NOT trip dunning), advance `next_billing_date`, hand to Amplifier, record a `type='comp'` succeeded transaction. Never routes to dunning. Partial index `idx_subscriptions_comp (workspace_id) WHERE comp = true` backs the comp list view. Migrate an Appstle sub onto comp rails with `migrateContractToInternalComp` ([[../libraries/migrate-to-internal]]).
- **`last_payment_status` writers differ by sub flavor.** Appstle subs are flipped to `'succeeded'`/`'failed'`/`'skipped'` by the Appstle billing webhook ([[../inngest/appstle-subscription-handler]]; `src/app/api/webhooks/appstle/[workspaceId]/route.ts`). **Internal subs have no such webhook** — they're flipped to `'succeeded'` by the internal-renewal success path ([[../inngest/internal-subscription-renewals]] `advance-next-billing-date` step) AND by `closeInternalDunningOnSuccess` ([[../inngest/internal-dunning]]) as a defence-in-depth backstop when the dunning cycle is closed from a non-renewal path. The portal change-date / change-frequency / subscription-detail handlers gate on `last_payment_status === 'failed'` — if that flag is ever leaked stale on an internal sub, the customer is permanently locked out of self-serve (see escalated ticket `efe0d2ad`). A backfill cleanup for historically-stuck rows lives at `scripts/backfill-internal-sub-last-payment-status.ts`.
- **Internal-sub items are catalog references, not prices.** Each line is `{ variant_id (product_variants.id UUID), product_id (UUID), title, variant_title, sku, quantity, line_id, price_override_cents? }`. The price is **derived live** by the pricing engine ([[../libraries/pricing]]) from the catalog + [[pricing_rules]] — never baked. `price_override_cents` is the only price an internal sub carries, and only for grandfathered lines. A baked `price_cents` is legacy; mutations strip it. (Appstle subs are unchanged — they keep Appstle/Shopify-baked prices and Shopify variant ids.)
