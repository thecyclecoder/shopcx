# Recipe: the self-hosted build box

The box that runs autonomous spec builds on the **Max subscription** for the [[../specs/roadmap-build-console]] (the "do it" button). Reachable only over Tailscale. This page is the reproducible runbook + the day-to-day ops.

## What it is

- **Hetzner CCX33** — Ubuntu 26.04, 8 vCPU, 30 GiB RAM, name `claude-server`. Public IPv4 `178.156.246.235` (firewalled), tailnet IP `100.75.99.7`.
- Runs `systemd` service **`shopcx-builder`** = `scripts/builder-worker.ts`, which polls [[../tables/agent_jobs]], claims a job via `claim_agent_job()`, runs `claude -p` (Max), tsc-gates, and opens a `claude/*` PR. See [[../dashboard/branches]] to merge.

## Core invariants

- **Max billing.** Builds run `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY claude -p …`. The box must have **no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** in the environment — `/root/shopcx/.env.local` keeps it commented out. Claude is logged in as the **Max** account (`dylan@superfoodscompany.com`); creds live in `/root/.claude`. Verify: claude.ai/settings/usage moves, the API console stays flat.
- **No inbound.** The box only reaches *out* (to Supabase + GitHub). Public SSH (:22) is firewalled; the trigger is a DB row the worker polls, never an HTTP call in.
- **One worker.** Only the `shopcx-builder` service runs the worker (don't also start a `nohup` copy).

## Day-to-day ops (over the tailnet)

```bash
ssh root@100.75.99.7   # plain ssh, tailnet IP, default ~/.ssh/id_ed25519. NOT `tailscale ssh` (no Tailscale SSH server) and NOT builder@. Live repo = /home/builder/shopcx (git as `sudo -u builder`); /root/shopcx is a STALE clone, ignore it.
systemctl status shopcx-builder          # health
journalctl -u shopcx-builder -f          # live logs
systemctl restart shopcx-builder         # restart
# Manual worker redeploy — RARELY NEEDED now (the worker self-updates when idle, below). Still the
# escape hatch if self-update is wedged. Deploy when the queue is IDLE — a restart kills in-flight lanes:
sudo -u builder git -C /home/builder/shopcx fetch origin && sudo -u builder git -C /home/builder/shopcx reset --hard origin/main && systemctl restart shopcx-builder
```

## Worker self-update (worker-self-update, shipped 2026-06-19)

The worker keeps **its own code** current — a merged worker fix goes live within one idle cycle, **zero manual redeploy** (closes the gap that left #77's `markReady` fix inert until a human ran the command above, so PRs kept coming out draft).

- **Idle self-update loop.** Each poll tick, **only when `active.size === 0`** (no build/fold lane — in-flight work is sacrosanct), the worker `git fetch origin main` and compares local `HEAD` to `origin/main`. If behind: `git reset --hard origin/main`, `npm ci` **if `package-lock.json` changed**, then `process.exit(0)` — `systemd Restart=always` relaunches on the fresh `builder-worker.ts`. A clean exit + restart is the safe re-exec (never hot-reload in-process). Worktrees live in the sibling `/home/builder/builds/`, so resetting the main repo never touches a running build. The journal logs the `from→to` short SHA.
- **No thrash.** Self-update only fires when `HEAD != origin/main`, at most once per `SELF_UPDATE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (60s).
- **Crash-loop guard.** A per-SHA startup counter persists in `/home/builder/.worker-startup.json`. If a freshly-pulled worker keeps dying on startup (same SHA, ≥ `CRASH_LOOP_MAX = 3`), it writes a `needs_attention` [[../tables/worker_heartbeats|heartbeat]] (the breadcrumb) and `exit(1)`s so systemd's `StartLimit` stops the flapping instead of churning a broken commit. The counter zeroes on the first clean poll tick. **Falls back to manual redeploy** (above).
- **Heartbeat.** Every tick the worker upserts [[../tables/worker_heartbeats]] (running SHA · `active_builds` · `last_poll_at`); [[../dashboard/branches]] shows a **Build box** banner so "is the box behind?" is answerable from the UI.

**Required systemd config for the crash-loop guard** (in `/etc/systemd/system/shopcx-builder.service`): `Restart=always` (relaunch on the self-update `exit(0)`) **plus** a start-limit so a flapping worker is eventually parked rather than restarted forever:

```ini
[Unit]
StartLimitIntervalSec=300
StartLimitBurst=5
[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
```

**Bootstrapping:** self-update ships in `builder-worker.ts` itself, so the **one last manual redeploy** (the command above) activates it; every redeploy after that is automatic.

## Provisioning (how it was built — to reproduce)

1. **Tailscale.** `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh` → `tailscale up` (authorize in the admin console). Put the Mac + phone on the same tailnet (`dylanralston@gmail.com`).
2. **Lock down SSH** (run over the tailnet so you can't lock yourself out): `ufw default deny incoming; ufw default allow outgoing; ufw allow in on tailscale0; ufw allow 41641/udp; ufw --force enable`. Confirm public :22 times out and tailnet SSH still works **before** trusting it.
3. **Stack.** Node 24 (`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs`), `build-essential`, Claude Code (`npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`), `npm i -g tsx`.
4. **Auth Claude → Max.** `claude` → `/login` → sign in with the Max account. Creds persist in `/root/.claude`. **Do not** set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
5. **Repo + secrets.** Clone with a token (`git clone https://x-access-token:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/thecyclecoder/shopcx.git /root/shopcx`), `npm install`, drop in `.env.local` (prod secrets + `GITHUB_TOKEN`) **with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` commented out**.
6. **Service.** `/etc/systemd/system/shopcx-builder.service` → `ExecStart=/usr/bin/tsx scripts/builder-worker.ts`, `WorkingDirectory=/root/shopcx`, `Environment=HOME=/root`, `Restart=always`, **plus `StartLimitIntervalSec=300` / `StartLimitBurst=5`** (so the self-update crash-loop guard can park a flapping worker — see § Worker self-update). Then `systemctl enable --now shopcx-builder`.

## Gotchas (learned in the live bring-up 2026-06-18)

- **A fresh box has no git identity** → `git commit` silently fails → empty branch → GitHub rejects the PR ("No commits between…"). The worker now sets a repo-local identity itself (`ensureGitIdentity`) and fails loudly on commit/push/PR errors.
- **`tsx` wasn't installed** → the worker was fetched via `npx` each boot. Installed globally so `systemd` runs it reliably.
- **`pkill -f builder-worker.ts` matches its own shell** (the pattern is in the command's argv) — kill by process group / pidfile, or let `systemd` manage it.

## Non-root builder + sandboxed builds (build-approval-gates, 2026-06-18)

`shopcx-builder` now runs as the **non-root `builder` user** from `/home/builder/shopcx` (its own clone + `/home/builder/.claude` Max login), so builds run `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (refused as root) with no per-tool prompts. Prod stays safe via two secret stores:
- **`/root/shopcx-worker.env`** (root-only `0600`, systemd `EnvironmentFile=`) holds the worker's prod creds (Supabase service role, DB password, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, …); systemd injects them into the worker process.
- The builder repo has **no `.env.local`**, and the worker **strips secrets from the spawned build's env** (`SECRET_RE` in `builder-worker.ts`) — so the `claude -p` build can't reach prod. The worker (which holds the creds) executes only **owner-approved** gated actions.

Update worker code: `sudo -u builder git -C /home/builder/shopcx fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main && systemctl restart shopcx-builder`.

## Parallel builds — 5 worktree-isolated lanes (parallel-builds, shipped 2026-06-18)

The worker runs **up to `MAX_CONCURRENT = 5` builds at once**, each in its own **git worktree** under `/home/builder/builds/{job-id}` (isolated dir + branch) so concurrent builds never clobber each other. The pool claims (`claim_agent_job()`) up to 5 jobs per poll tick and tops up as lanes free; a resume recreates a worktree on the job's pushed branch, and every worktree is torn down (`git worktree remove --force`) on any outcome. Cap = **5** because the real ceiling is **Max rate limits**, not the 8-core box (tune `MAX_CONCURRENT`).

**Three gotchas that bit us in bring-up (permanent notes):**
- **Async exec is mandatory.** `runClaude` / `tsc` / approved-action `bash` use `shAsync` (`spawn`, non-blocking), **not `spawnSync`**. `spawnSync` blocks Node's event loop for the *entire* (up to 30-min) build → the 5-lane pool silently collapses to ~1 real lane. Any new long-running step must use `shAsync`.
- **`node_modules` is gitignored** → absent in a fresh worktree → `tsc` fails. The worker force-symlinks the main clone's `node_modules` into each worktree (`ln -sfn`).
- **`.env.local` is absent on the box** (secrets come from the `EnvironmentFile`) → an apply-script that hard-reads it crashes with ENOENT and the migration silently "fails" through the approval gate. The `write-migration` skill now guards the read (`existsSync`) + falls back to `process.env`.
- **Draft-PR trap:** a build that paused (needs_input/needs_approval) opens its PR as a **draft**; on completion the worker now calls `markReady` (GraphQL `markPullRequestReadyForReview`) or it stays unmergeable.

**Separate per-kind lanes (beyond the 5-lane build pool):** `MAX_FOLD = 1` (fold-builds), `MAX_SEED = 2` (product-seeds), and `MAX_SPEC_CHAT = 1` (box-spec-chat authoring-chat turns). Each is filled by its own `claim_agent_job(['<kind>'])` call before the build/plan pool, and excluded from the build-pool count, so an interactive chat turn or a long seed never steals a feature-build lane (and vice-versa). The **spec-chat** lane ([[../specs/box-spec-chat]]) runs each authoring-chat turn as a resumable `claude -p` on Max in a **stable per-chat worktree** (`builds/spec-chat-{chat_id}`, recreated on `origin/main` each turn) — stable because `claude --resume` is cwd-scoped; concurrency-1 keeps two turns of the same chat off the same dir.

**Recovery / fleet ops:** [[manage-the-build-queue]] (`queue-control`) — pause by stopping the worker, `reset-all` to a clean slate, `requeue-stale` after a restart orphans in-flight lanes.

**Interactive Max lanes (no PR).** Beyond the 5 build/plan worktree lanes + the concurrency-1 fold lane, the worker fills five more dedicated lanes each poll tick: `['product-seed']` (`MAX_SEED=2`, [[../specs/box-product-seeding]]), `['ticket-improve']` (`MAX_TICKET_IMPROVE=1`, [[../specs/box-ticket-improve]] — one resumable Max turn per ticket, reads brain/`src/` in the main checkout read-only, never mutates / opens a PR), `['triage-escalations']` (`MAX_TRIAGE=1`, [[../specs/box-escalation-triage]] — the hourly escalation sweep, `runEscalationTriageJob`), `['spec-test']` (`MAX_SPEC_TEST=1`, [[../specs/spec-test-agent]] — the daily QA pass over one shipped-but-unverified spec, `runSpecTestJob`, in the main checkout read-only), and `['migration-fix']` (`MAX_MIGRATION_FIX=1`, [[../specs/migration-fix-agent]] — `runMigrationFixJob`, in the main checkout, diagnoses a failed migration read-only then proposes a gated billing repair). All run as top-level `claude -p` on Max (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset) and keep the DB/crypto secrets so their deterministic CLI tools can reach prod — product-seed writes; ticket-improve only reads (via `scripts/improve-box-tools.ts`) and spec-test only reads (via `scripts/spec-test-db-probe.ts`, `gh`, `vercel`, GET hits); **migration-fix reads for the diagnosis but its mutations are gated to the server-side approval path** (the worker runs [[../libraries/migration-fix]] `applyMigrationFix` only on owner approval), with any mutation gated to the server-side approval path.

**Event-fired migration-fix (migration-fix-agent, shipped 2026-06-20).** UNLIKE the cron-enqueued spec-test/triage lanes, the migration-fix lane is fired by an **event, not a cron**: [[../libraries/migration-audit]] `verifyMigration` enqueues a `kind='migration-fix'` [[../tables/agent_jobs]] job the moment a [[../tables/migration_audits]] row transitions to `failed` (a renewal at risk). The worker claims it on the **concurrency-1 `MAX_MIGRATION_FIX=1` lane** and runs the `migration-fix` skill: diagnose the failing checks read-only over a baked-in brief (audit + sub + catalog + engine pricing + the live Appstle contract) → propose a typed fix (`price_reconcile`/`variant_backfill`/`appstle_cancel`) parked in `pending_actions`. The owner approves on [[../dashboard/migrations]] (`/api/roadmap/approve` → `queued_resume`); the worker executes via [[../libraries/migration-fix]] `applyMigrationFix` then re-runs `verifyMigration` — only a re-`passed` clears the row; unfixable (no billable card) stays `failed` with the box's written diagnosis. No PR.

**Daily spec-test QA (spec-test-agent, shipped 2026-06-20).** Like triage, an **Inngest cron enqueues the sweep**: `spec-test-cron` ([[../inngest/spec-test-cron]], `45 10 * * *`, concurrency-1) inserts one `kind='spec-test'` [[../tables/agent_jobs]] row per shipped-but-not-archived spec (`deriveStatus==shipped` AND no `archive.d/{slug}.md`), per build-console workspace, deduped against an in-flight job or a fresh (<20h) run. The worker claims each on the **concurrency-1 `MAX_SPEC_TEST=1` lane** and runs the `spec-test` skill — classify each `## Verification` bullet (auto / needs-human / mutating→needs-human) and run only the **non-destructive** checks (repo/`tsc`, `gh` CI, `vercel` deploy+logs+env, read-only DB probes via `scripts/spec-test-db-probe.ts`, GET endpoints) — writing one [[../tables/spec_test_runs]] row with an `agent_verdict` stamp. **No PR; never mutates prod; never marks a spec verified/archived** (that owner-only gate stays untouched). Surfaced on **Developer → Spec Tests**, the board card chip, and the spec's VerificationCard.

**Vercel CLI provisioning (spec-test-agent).** The spec-test agent needs the **`vercel` CLI** + a **read-scoped `VERCEL_TOKEN`** to confirm the deploy is READY, read build/runtime logs, and check `vercel env ls`. Install on the box (`npm i -g vercel`) and add `VERCEL_TOKEN` to the worker env (`/root/shopcx-worker.env`, the systemd `EnvironmentFile`) — **owner op** (token minting is the owner's; surface it as a gated action if missing). `gh`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` are already present. If `vercel`/`VERCEL_TOKEN` is absent the agent degrades gracefully: it marks Vercel-dependent bullets `inconclusive` (with that reason) rather than failing them.

**Playwright / chromium provisioning (spec-test-deep-verification Phase 1).** The spec-test agent's **headless-browser check** (`scripts/spec-test-browser-check.ts`) needs the chromium browser binary + its system libs. Provision it on the box **as root** (owner op): `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. The `playwright` npm package is in `package.json` (picked up by the worker's `npm ci` on self-update), so only the browser/system-deps install is a manual root step — run it once (and after a major Playwright bump). No new token: the tool mints the **owner Supabase session server-side** from the service-role key already in the worker env (no human creds). Screenshots land in the private **`spec-test-evidence`** Storage bucket, which the tool creates idempotently on first run (`ensureSpecTestEvidenceBucket`). If chromium is missing, browser-check bullets surface as `inconclusive`/error (the launch throws) rather than passing silently.

**Hourly escalation triage (triage-escalations, shipped 2026-06-20).** The box has no internal ticker, so an **Inngest cron enqueues the sweep** (the [[../inngest/portal-auto-resume]] precedent): `triage-escalations-cron` ([[../inngest/triage-escalations]], `30 * * * *`, concurrency-1) inserts one `kind='triage-escalations'` [[../tables/agent_jobs]] row per workspace with a routine-owned escalated ticket. The worker claims it on the **concurrency-1 `MAX_TRIAGE=1` lane** and sweeps up to `TRIAGE_CAP` (default 5, env `AGENT_TODO_TRIAGE_CAP`) tickets, running a **solver→skeptic→quorum** loop as 2–4 separate `claude -p` Max sessions per ticket. On quorum it materializes (customer fix → `pending` [[../tables/agent_todos]] · rule → `proposed` [[../tables/sonnet_prompts]] · code/analyzer fix → a `docs/brain/specs/` file committed straight to main); every ticket per sweep gets a [[../tables/triage_runs]] audit row. No PR (specs commit via the Contents API like the planner). This **replaced the retired Anthropic-cloud agent-todo routine** ([[../lifecycles/agent-todo-system]]).
