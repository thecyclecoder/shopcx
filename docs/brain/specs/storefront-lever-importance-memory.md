# Lever-importance model + CRO-learnings memory

**Owner:** [[../functions/growth]] · **Parent:** M2 — Lever-importance model + CRO-learnings memory
**Blocked-by:** [[storefront-experiment-bandit-framework]]

The persistent **brain** of the [[../goals/storefront-optimizer]] agent — the memory that turns one-off experiments into a compounding system. Today no lever-importance / CRO-memory store exists; the design lives only in the goal doc (§ "The lever-importance model"). This spec builds it: a hierarchical, **learned** chapter→component lever-importance map seeded with CRO **priors** and updated to a **posterior** by each [[storefront-experiment-bandit-framework|M1 experiment]] outcome — a **two-level bandit** (*which lever to test* × *which variant wins*). A headline variant with ~0% LTV-proxy delta demotes "headline" for that `(product × lander-type × audience)`; the agent then spends its next tests on the **high-posterior** levers instead of guessing. Importance scores **decay / get re-probed** so a written-off lever can resurrect (a bolder hero may make the headline matter again), and learnings are tagged **product-specific vs general** for cross-product transfer. Every campaign commits a learning here — **win or loss**. Serves the success metric by directing scarce test budget at the levers that actually move predicted-LTV-per-visitor.

## Phase 1 — the hierarchical lever taxonomy + priors
- ✅ shipped — migration `20260624120000_storefront_levers.sql` (table + seed), [[../tables/storefront_levers]], funnel-prior helper `seedChapterPriorsFromFunnel`.
- New table `storefront_levers` — the canonical hierarchy: **chapter** level (hero, pricing-table, social-proof, ingredients, FAQ, …) and **component** level decomposing a chapter (hero = `image · headline · benefit_chips · review_snippet · trust_badges`). Columns: `parent_lever_id` (self-FK for chapter→component), `lever_key`, `chapter`, `lander_type` applicability.
- Seed each lever with a CRO **prior** importance (hero dominant, pricing-clarity #2 — the goal's § CRO principles), and seed the chapter-level priors from the **real funnel data we already have**: per-chapter dwell + CTA-click share from [[../tables/storefront_events]] (`chapter_dwell`/`cta_click`, surfaced on [[../dashboard/storefront__funnel]]). Migration + [[write-brain-page]] `tables/storefront_levers.md`.

## Phase 2 — the learned posterior store
- ✅ shipped — [[../tables/storefront_lever_importance]] + [[../libraries/storefront-lever-memory]] `updatePosterior`, wired into [[../libraries/storefront-experiment-refresh]] on every terminal (promote/kill/rolled_back) decision.
- New table `storefront_lever_importance` — one posterior row per `(lever_id, product_id, lander_type, audience)`: `importance` (current posterior), `prior`, `n_tests`, `last_tested_at`, `evidence` (jsonb of contributing experiment ids + their proxy deltas), `scope` ∈ `product_specific｜general`.
- `src/lib/storefront/lever-memory.ts` — `updatePosterior(experiment)` consumes a completed M1 experiment ([[storefront-experiment-bandit-framework]] outcome + the M3 predicted-LTV-proxy delta as the reward) and Bayesian-updates the tested lever's importance: a meaningful proxy lift raises it, a ~0 delta demotes it. Idempotent per experiment (keyed by experiment id in `evidence`).

## Phase 3 — decay / re-probe (explore on levers)
- ✅ shipped — [[../inngest/storefront-lever-decay]] (daily `0 13 * * *`) calls `decayLeverImportance`; `nextLeverToTest` is the explore/exploit selector.
- A scheduled pass (Inngest, mirror the M1 refresh cadence) **decays** importance toward the prior as `last_tested_at` ages, so a written-off lever's posterior drifts back up enough to be **re-probed** later. Expose `nextLeverToTest({product, lander_type, audience})` — the explore/exploit selector that returns the highest-value lever to test next (high posterior = exploit; decayed/never-tested = explore), the *which-lever* half of the two-level bandit the M4 agent calls.

## Phase 4 — cross-product transfer + M3 recalibration intake
- ✅ shipped — `seedCellPrior` transfers `general` learnings to new cells; `applyReconciliationSignal` ingests the M3 signal (best-effort); the "what the agent believes matters" panel is on the funnel dashboard.
- Tag each learning `product_specific` vs `general`; when a new `(product × lander-type × audience)` has no posterior yet, **seed from the `general` learnings** (cross-product transfer) rather than cold priors.
- Subscribe to the [[storefront-ltv-proxy-reconciler|M3 reconciler]]'s recalibration signal: when the slow loop finds a lever class systematically over/under-predicted (e.g. discount-heavy offers churn), adjust that lever's importance posterior accordingly (cross-link to M3 Phase 3; read the signal if present, no hard dependency).
- Surface the importance map on [[../dashboard/storefront__funnel]] (a "what the agent believes matters" panel).

## Safety / invariants
- **Memory is append-evidence, not destructive.** A posterior update appends the contributing experiment to `evidence` and recomputes — a loss is recorded as much as a win (the goal: "commit the learning to memory, win or loss"). Never silently drop a learning.
- **Idempotent updates.** Each experiment updates a posterior exactly once (deduped by experiment id); a re-run never double-counts.
- **Decay keeps exploration alive.** No lever is permanently dead — importance decays toward prior so a written-off lever can resurrect.
- **Scoped + transferable.** Every learning is tagged `product_specific｜general`; only `general` transfers cross-product.
- **The map is a tool, not the objective.** It directs test budget; the [[../functions/growth|Growth director]] + the M3 reconciler supervise it ([[../operational-rules]] § North star). A surprising posterior swing is surfaced, not silently trusted.

## Completion criteria
- `storefront_levers` encodes the chapter→component hierarchy with CRO priors + funnel-data-seeded chapter priors.
- `storefront_lever_importance` holds learned posteriors per `(lever × product × lander-type × audience)`, updated idempotently from M1 experiment outcomes (reward = M3 proxy delta).
- Importance decays with age and `nextLeverToTest` returns an explore/exploit-balanced choice.
- `general` learnings seed a brand-new `(product × lander-type × audience)` (cross-product transfer demonstrated).
- The reconciler's recalibration signal adjusts the relevant posteriors.
- The importance map is surfaced on the funnel dashboard.

## Verification
- Run `npx tsx scripts/apply-storefront-lever-memory-migration.ts` → expect `✓ public.storefront_levers has 12 columns`, `✓ public.storefront_lever_importance has 15 columns`, and `✓ seeded 22 levers (top: hero=0.9, …)`. In Supabase confirm the self-FK `parent_lever_id` (`storefront_levers_parent_idx`) and the unique index `storefront_lever_importance_cell_uniq` on `(lever_id, product_id, lander_type, audience)`.
- `select chapter, lever_key, prior from storefront_levers order by prior desc;` → expect `hero` (0.90) top, `pricing_table` (0.78) #2, `social_proof` (0.62) #3 — the funnel-informed CRO ranking; components (`image` 0.62, `headline` 0.58, …) hang off their chapter via `parent_lever_id`.
- (optional) `npx tsx -e "import('./src/lib/storefront/lever-memory').then(m=>m.seedChapterPriorsFromFunnel({workspaceId:'<ws>',apply:true}).then(r=>console.log(r)))"` → recompute chapter priors from live `chapter_dwell`/`cta_click` share and write them onto the chapter levers.
- Let the M1 refresh promote/kill a hero-`image` experiment with a meaningful proxy lift on Amazing Coffee (or call `updatePosterior` directly with its rollups) → `select importance, prior, n_tests, evidence from storefront_lever_importance sli join storefront_levers sl on sl.id=sli.lever_id where sl.lever_key='image';` → `importance` raised above `prior`, `n_tests=1`, the experiment id in `evidence`. A `headline` experiment with ~0 delta → that cell's `importance` demoted below `prior`. Re-run the refresh on the same terminal experiment → `n_tests` stable (idempotent dedup by experiment id).
- Run the decay pass (`storefront-lever-decay` / `decayLeverImportance`) with a stale `last_tested_at` → expect `importance` drifted toward `prior`; call `nextLeverToTest({productId, landerType})` → expect `choice.reason='exploit'` for a high-posterior lever and a `explore_decayed`/`explore_never_tested` candidate surfaced for re-probe in `candidates`.
- Call `nextLeverToTest` for a NEW `(product × lander × audience)` that has a `general` learning on another product → expect the candidate's `seeded_from='general_transfer'` (its prior = the cross-product average), not `cro_prior`.
- With an M3 `storefront_ltv_reconciliations` row carrying a `lever_key` + material `error_pct`, run `applyReconciliationSignal` → expect a `source='m3_reconciler'` evidence entry (keyed `m3:<id>`) on the matching cells and a recomputed `importance`. Absent the M3 table → `{present:false, applied:0}` (no error).
- On `/dashboard/storefront/funnel` → expect a "What the agent believes matters" panel listing levers with current `importance`, the `vs prior` delta, scope, tests, and last-tested age.
