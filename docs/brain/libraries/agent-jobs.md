# libraries/agent-jobs

Server-side helpers over the [[../tables/agent_jobs]] build queue — the dashboard "Build" button inserts a row; the box worker claims it via `claim_agent_job()` and drives it to a PR. Also home to the **shared spec-test enqueue guard** ([[../specs/spec-test-on-ship]]). See [[../lifecycles/roadmap-build-console]].

**File:** `src/lib/agent-jobs.ts`

## Types

- `JobStatus` — `queued｜claimed｜building｜needs_input｜needs_approval｜queued_resume｜completed｜merged｜failed｜needs_attention`. `ACTIVE_STATUSES` / `isActive()` classify the live ones.
- `JobKind` — `build｜plan｜fold｜product-seed｜ticket-improve` (the box also runs `spec-test` jobs, inserted by `enqueueSpecTestIfDue` + the cron).
- `AgentJob`, `PendingAction` / `GatedActionType` / `ProposedSpec` (planner branch proposals), `PendingFold`.

## Exports

### `enqueueSpecTestIfDue` — function  *(spec-test-on-ship)*

```ts
async function enqueueSpecTestIfDue(
  workspaceId: string, slug: string, knownStatus?: Phase,
): Promise<{ enqueued: boolean; reason?: string }>
```

The **single dedupe chokepoint** shared by all three spec-test enqueue paths: the daily backlog cron ([[../inngest/spec-test-cron]]), the manual status flip (`POST /api/roadmap/status`), and the build-merge reconcile (`reconcileMergedJobs`). Inserts one `queued` `agent_jobs` row `kind='spec-test'` for `(workspaceId, slug)` **iff** the spec is **shipped-but-not-archived** AND not already covered — **no in-flight** spec-test job (`status` ∈ `queued｜queued_resume｜building｜claimed`) **and no fresh** [[../tables/spec_test_runs]] row (last ~20h). First caller wins; the rest no-op. Re-running is allowed once the spec changes again (a fresh ship state past the window).

- `knownStatus` — when a caller already holds the freshly-derived status, pass it to skip a disk re-read of the spec (the cron passes `'shipped'`; the status route passes `deriveSpecStatus(updated)` over the just-committed content, since the deployed bundle's local disk is stale vs. that commit). Omit it to derive **shipped-but-not-archived** from disk (`getSpec` + `listArchivedSlugs`, [[brain-roadmap]]).

### `reconcileMergedJobs` — function

```ts
async function reconcileMergedJobs(jobs: AgentJob[]): Promise<void>
```

Self-heal: a `completed` job whose PR was merged/closed **outside** the dashboard still shows a stale "Squash & merge" button. Checks GitHub; if the PR is no longer open, flips the job to `merged` (in place + persisted). **spec-drift Part A (root fix):** when a merged (`pr.merged`) `kind='build'` job is flipped, it calls `reconcileSpecDrift(workspace, slug)` ([[spec-drift]]) — the per-phase, evidence-gated reconciler that stamps ✅ on phases whose code is verifiably on `main` (a merged build now exists for the spec), leaving genuinely-pending phases. This is where drift originates; closing it on merge means the [[../inngest/spec-drift-reconcile]] cron rarely has work. If the corrected phases now derive `shipped`, it then calls `enqueueSpecTestIfDue(...,'shipped')` **then** `autoQueueUnblockedBy(...)` (spec-blockers Phase 2) — the reconciler's returned status replaces the old `fetchSpecFromMain` + `deriveSpecStatus` check. Called on board load ([[../dashboard/roadmap]]) and the merge path (`/api/roadmap/build`).

### `autoQueueUnblockedBy` — function  *(spec-blockers Phase 2)*

```ts
async function autoQueueUnblockedBy(workspaceId: string, shippedSlug: string): Promise<string[]>
```

Auto-queue on unblock. `shippedSlug` just shipped (its build PR merged + phases flipped ✅); this finds every **live** spec (via `getRoadmap`) that named it in `**Blocked-by:**` and, if that was its **last** uncleared blocker (`blockedBy.every(b => b.cleared || b.slug === shippedSlug)` — `shippedSlug` is treated as cleared so a deploy-stale disk snapshot of its status can't suppress the unblock), inserts a `queued` `kind='build'` row (`created_by=null`, instructions naming the prerequisite). The chain goes hands-off: merge the prerequisite, the dependent build fires itself. **Skips** a dependent that already has ANY `build` job (dedupe — *one auto-queue per spec*, so calling this on every board load no-ops), is itself `shipped`, or opted out via `**Auto-build:** off` (`SpecCard.autoBuild === false`). Returns the slugs queued. Called from `reconcileMergedJobs`.

### Read helpers

- `getLatestPlanJob(workspaceId, goalSlug)` — newest `plan` job for a goal (drives Plan/Re-plan).
- `getLatestJobsBySlug(workspaceId)` — latest job per spec (board per-card status).
- `getPendingFolds(workspaceId)` — specs queued for / mid- a fold-build ([[../specs/fold-build-batching]]).

## Tables written

- [[../tables/agent_jobs]] (inserts `spec-test` rows via `enqueueSpecTestIfDue`; inserts auto-queued `build` rows via `autoQueueUnblockedBy` — [[../specs/spec-blockers]]; flips jobs → `merged` in `reconcileMergedJobs`)

## Tables read (not written)

- [[../tables/agent_jobs]] (in-flight dedupe, latest-job/plan lookups), [[../tables/spec_test_runs]] (fresh-run dedupe), [[../tables/pending_folds]]
- `docs/brain/specs/**` + `docs/brain/archive.d/**` via [[brain-roadmap]] (`getSpec` / `listArchivedSlugs` / `deriveSpecStatus`) — and GitHub `contents` (via [[spec-drift]] `reconcileSpecDrift` on the merge path)
