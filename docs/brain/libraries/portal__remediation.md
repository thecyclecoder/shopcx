# libraries/portal/remediation

Triage + auto-resolution for **"Portal action needs help"** tickets — the ones created when a customer hits an error doing a self-serve portal action (see [[portal__route]] / `app/api/portal/route.ts`, which tags them `portal-action-failed`). Those tickets carry no customer message, so the AI pipeline never runs on them; without this they just pile up open forever.

**File:** `src/lib/portal/remediation.ts`

## What it does

Each ticket is classified into one of three dispositions and acted on:

| Disposition | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **retry** | Transient Appstle/infra error — *"Another billing operation is already in progress"*, timeouts, 429/503/504 | Re-run the original action via `healPortalAction`; close on success |
| **dismiss** | User/UI validation error that can't be completed — *"Insufficient points"*, *"at least one subscription product must be present"* | Close + tag `auto-dismissed` |
| **human** | Anything unrecognized, or retries exhausted (3), or a non-transient error surfaced on retry | Tag `needs-human`, leave open |

The same entry point (`remediatePortalTicket`) is used by the manual one-off pass and the [[../inngest/portal-action-healer]] cron, so behaviour is identical.

## Key design decisions

- **Classify on the error *message*, not the HTTP status.** The portal route wraps **every** Appstle error as HTTP 502 (`handleAppstleError`), so the status is useless for transient detection. A genuine hard error (e.g. *"Next billing date is invalid"*) would retry forever if we trusted 502. We key off the message text.
- **Failure context comes from the `portal.error` customer_event, latest-wins.** A customer who retried a date change three times wants the date from their **last** attempt, not the stale value baked into the ticket note. `getFailureContext` pulls the most recent `portal.error` event for that customer+route at/after ticket creation; falls back to parsing the creation note for older tickets.
- **`needs-human`-tagged tickets are skipped on every subsequent pass.** They stay open (for an agent), but re-running the replay each tick would hammer Appstle with a known-bad action. The tag is a terminal state for the automation.
- **Attempt count is derived from the ticket's own `[Auto-heal attempt N]` notes** — no extra column. After `MAX_HEAL_ATTEMPTS` (3) transient failures the ticket goes `needs-human`.
- **Only idempotent routes have a replay.** `healPortalAction` currently implements `changedate` → `appstleUpdateNextBillingDate` (the one real healable case seen in production). Unknown routes return `unsupported` → routed to a human, never guessed. Add routes to the `switch` as needed; never add a non-idempotent one (e.g. `order-now` would double-charge).

## Exports

- `remediatePortalTicket(admin, ticket)` → `RemediationOutcome` — triage + act on one ticket. Idempotent.
- `fetchOpenPortalFailures(admin, workspaceId, windowDays=14)` → `TicketRow[]` — open `portal-action-failed` tickets in the recent window.
- `classifyPortalFailure(ctx)` → `{ disposition, reason }`
- `healPortalAction(admin, workspaceId, ctx)` → `{ success, detail?, error?, unsupported? }`
- `getFailureContext(admin, ticket)` → `FailureContext | null`
- `routeFromSubject(subject)` → route slug

## Callers

- [[../inngest/portal-action-healer]] — the 15-min cron
- `scripts/_portal-remediate.ts` — manual one-off pass (used to clear the first batch, 2026-06-11)

## Source prevention

`app/api/portal/route.ts` now skips ticket creation for validation errors that should never have been offered — including `insufficient_points` and any `error` matching `/^insufficient points/i`. The loyalty redeem UI already disables unaffordable tiers (`affordable` flag from `loyaltyBalance`, same `member.points_balance` source as the server-side `validateRedemption`), so a real ticket here means a stale/old client — the route guard stops it spawning a ticket regardless.
