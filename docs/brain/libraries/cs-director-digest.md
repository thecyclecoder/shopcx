# cs-director-digest

The **composer** behind the [[../tables/cs_director_digests]] table (Phase 1 of [[../specs/cs-director-storyline-digests-to-founder-with-bidirectional-reply]]).

**File:** `src/lib/cs-director-digest.ts`

Rolls up the CS Director's per-week signal into one row per (workspace, week) so the founder reads a batched digest instead of a per-ticket paging firehose. Called from the weekly [[../inngest/cs-director-digest-composer]] cron.

## Exports

| Name | Signature | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `composeCsDirectorDigest` | `(admin, workspaceId, since, until) → { inserted, row, storylineCount }` | Composes and inserts (or short-circuits on an existing row) one [[../tables/cs_director_digests]] row for the workspace's period. Idempotent per `(workspace_id, digest_period_start)`. Never throws. |
| `appendPerTicketEscalation` | `(admin, {workspaceId, ticketId, reasoning, verdictMetadata}) → { appended, digest_id, storyline_index }` | Phase 2 — append ONE `per_ticket_escalation` storyline to the LATEST digest row (or lazy-create one for the current week when none exists). Called from `runCsDirectorCallJob` on non-black-swan `escalate_founder` verdicts. Guarded UPDATE (`.eq('id',…).eq('workspace_id',…).select('id')`). Never throws. |
| `CsStoryline` | type | The `storylines[]` element shape — `{ kind, title, evidence, proposed_action: { type, payload? } }`. |
| `CsStorylineKind` | type | `'early_warning' \| 'precedent_call'`. |
| `CsStorylineProposedActionType` | type | `'widen_leash' \| 'tighten_leash' \| 'add_policy' \| 'add_rule' \| null` — the founder-actionable seed Phase 2's reply surface consumes. |
| `CsDirectorDigestRow` | type | The inserted row shape (mirrors the DB columns). |

## Sources composed

- **`director_activity`** — `director_function='cs' + action_kind='cs_director_call'` rows in the window. Each becomes ONE `precedent_call` storyline. `proposed_action.type` derives from the verdict's `metadata.decision`:
  - `escalate_founder` → `add_policy` (the CS Director hit her leash — the founder codifies the judgment)
  - `author_spec` → `add_rule` (a specific analyzer/rule gap — a `sonnet_prompts` seed until the spec ships)
  - `approve_remedy` → `null` (informational — the CS Director acted in leash)
- **`ticket_resolution_events`** — the `problem` text is normalized (whitespace collapsed + lowercased) and grouped. A problem that appears on ≥ `RECURRING_PROBLEM_THRESHOLD` (=3) DISTINCT tickets in the window becomes one `early_warning` storyline; `proposed_action.type` defaults to `add_policy` (the systemic fix is written policy, not a per-call leash tweak).
- **`ticket_resolution_events` `reasoning='sol:cap-hit'`** — Fix 1 of [[../specs/sol-runaway-re-session-cap-guardrail]]. The rolling count of Sol re-session cap-hits in the window is compared against the workspace's [[../tables/ai_channel_config]] `sol_cap_hit_alarm` (max across channels; default `5`). When the count STRICTLY EXCEEDS the threshold, ONE `early_warning` storyline titled "Sol re-session cap hit (systemic)" is emitted with `evidence` = "{count} cap-hits in the window · threshold {N} · frustration {x} · drift {y}" and `proposed_action.type='add_policy'` (the systemic fix is either widening `sol_max_resessions` or codifying a rule that catches the pattern earlier). Below-threshold windows emit nothing.

- **`director_activity` `action_kind='sol_messy_turns'`** (Cora dial-in) — the per-ticket coaching signals emitted by BOTH Cora tiers ([[sol-coaching-signal]]: the cheap Haiku triage pass on a clean-close ticket + Cora's deep session on a no-escalation verdict). `composeMessyTurnWarnings` groups each row's `metadata.signals` (recovered-stumble classes) by CLASS, counts DISTINCT tickets, and emits one `early_warning` storyline per class that recurs across ≥ `RECURRING_PROBLEM_THRESHOLD` (=3) tickets. `proposed_action.type='add_rule'` — the systemic fix for a recurring Sol mid-turn pattern is a codified rule (a `sonnet_prompts` row) that catches it earlier, not a leash tweak. This is how June sees repeat patterns across a satisfactory-ending-but-messy-middle class of tickets that would never individually escalate.

Every source is best-effort — a failed read logs + returns `[]` for that source; the digest still ships with the surviving storylines. Never throws.

## Idempotency

Before inserting, `composeCsDirectorDigest` looks up `(workspace_id, digest_period_start)` on [[../tables/cs_director_digests]] via `existingDigestFor`. A hit returns `{ inserted:false, row: existing }` without composing — the [[../inngest/cs-director-digest-composer]] cron's `retries:1` retry can't fan out two digests for the same week, and a manual re-invocation reads back the same row.

## Invariants

- **Distinct-ticket count is the systemic signal.** `composeEarlyWarnings` counts DISTINCT `ticket_id`s per normalized problem — a problem repeated on the SAME ticket across many turns is not a systemic signal and does NOT surface as an early-warning storyline.
- **Every storyline carries a proposed_action.** Even `approve_remedy` precedents surface `{ type: null }` so Phase 2's reply surface always has a stable shape to render (an informational storyline with a disabled action panel), never a missing key.
- **Char caps on every field.** `title ≤ 160`, `evidence ≤ 800` — one digest row never balloons past a founder-readable size.
